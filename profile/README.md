## Try the Hosted Version

If you want to explore FlowFinder without setting up a self-hosted instance, you can try our hosted cloud version available at [https://flowfinder.org](https://flowfinder.org).  
The free tier of the cloud version includes all the features of this open-source release, with the following limitations:

- **Rate Limiting**: Only a limited number of sessions can be recorded per minute. Not all sessions are guaranteed to be stored.
- **Data Retention**: Session data retention may vary depending on server availability and capacity.

This option is ideal for quick testing or small-scale usage without needing to configure a backend environment.

FlowFinder.org also offers professional Cloud versions and technical support services.
